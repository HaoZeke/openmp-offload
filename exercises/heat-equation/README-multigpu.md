## Heat equation with multiple GPUs

Your task is now to combine the MPI parallelization as [described for CPU-only code](../heat-cpu/code-description.mdn) with the OpenMP offloading.

You can base your work on [hybrid MPI + OpenMP code](../heat-cpu/) and the previous work on 
offloading with single GPU.

In order to achieve a working multi-GPU code, you should:

1. Assign MPI tasks to devices
2a. Copy the data between host and device before and after the MPI communication
or
2b. Pass device pointer to MPI routines
3. Use OpenMP offload constructs in the `evolve` routine
