# Motivation

- By default, the host thread will wait until OpenMP `target` compute or data
  construct has completed its execution, *i.e.* there is an implicit
  barrier at the end of the `target`
- Potential parallelism in overlapping compute, data transfers, MPI,
  etc.

# Asynchronous execution: nowait and taskwait

- Â´target` construct creates an implicit OpenMP task
- Similar to OpenMP explicit task constructs (`task`, `taskloop`), `target` has
  a `nowait` clause
    - removes the implicit barrier
- Completion can be ensured with the `taskwait` construct
- Work on host (concurrent to accelerator) can be parallelized with
  OpenMP tasks

TODO: example code

# Task dependencies

- OpenMP tasks support data flow model, where a task can have input
  and output dependencies

<div class=column>
```c
// The two tasks can be executed concurrently
#pragma omp task
{do something}

#pragma omp task
{do something else}
```
</div>
<div class=column>
```c
// The two tasks can be executed concurrently
#pragma omp task depend(out:a)
{do something which produces a}

#pragma omp task depend(in:a)
{do something which uses a as input}
```
</div>

- Also `target` tasks support dependencies

# Task dependencies

TODO: example code


# Summary

- `target` construct creates an implicit OpenMP task
- OpenMP task functionalities (`nowait`, `taskwait`, `depend`) can
  be used for asynchronous execution on accelerators
- May enable better performance by overlapping different operations
    - Performance depends heavily on the underlying implementation
